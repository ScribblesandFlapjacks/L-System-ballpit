		<h1>Basic L-System Visualizer</h1>
		<div style="padding: 110px 0">
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Welcome. This is a simple visualizer for simple L-Systems. You can actually generate some
		pretty cool images without a deep understanding. The fundamental concept is that we are starting with
		a base sentence of "F", we call this the axiom. Then we have rules that can be thought of as taking one
		thing and replacing it with another. For instance if my rule is F -> F+- then for each iteration of generation
		we will replace each F with F+-. Gen 0 would just be our axiom F, gen 1 would be F+-, gen 2 would be F+-+-
		and so on and so forth. This tool I've built uses a simple alphabet that can be translated into simple drawing
		instructions. I have also given control of a few parameters that affect how the sentence will be drawn.
		</p>
		<ul style="text-align: left">
			<li>F tells the program to draw forward Line Draw Length far</li>
			<li>+ and - rotate the direction the next line will be drawn by the angle</li>
			<li>[ tells the program to remember it's current location.</li>
			<li>] tells the program to return to the last saved location</li>
			<li>Rule is what F will be replaced by in each iteration</li>
			<li>Scaling is meant to help you make sure the drawing stays in the canvas</li>
			<li>Center will place the origin of the drawing in the center of the canvas</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Rules with a lot of symbols can get graphically dense quickly and cause browser lag.
		Be careful with how many times you hit generate, especially with the default example.
