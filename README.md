# L-System-ballpit

Welcome to my ongoing L-system visualizer project. The core tools being used for this implementation
are [p5](https://p5js.org/) and basic javascript. The starting point for this project was a desire
to generate treelike structures with the long term goal of using evolutionary computation to generate
3 dimensional trees. To facilitate this desire I did some research and followed a tutorial. Resources
listed below:

* [Wikipedia article on L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
* [Chapter 5 of Procedural Content Generation in Games](http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter05.pdf)
* [A youtube tutorial for coding L-system visualization in p5. The initial code base of my project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1B4UoSQMFw)

Additional credit goes to day[9] and the [Day Knight 30 day project](https://dk30.day9.tv/) for giving me the motivation to work on this.

My basic approach thus far has been to create the project as a sort of stepwise tutorial where each page
introduces some new concepts and provides more control. This way users can slowly build their understanding
of L-systems in a fun and interactive way.

Current future goals include :

* Transitioning to interpreting L-systems into 3 dimensions
* Improving the creation of random rule sets
* Using evolutionary computation to do basic mutation and crossover on randomly generated L-system populations.

Hope you enjoy!
