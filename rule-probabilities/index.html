		<h1>Stochastic L-System Visualizer</h1>
		<div style="padding: 110px 0">
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Welcome. This is a simple visualizer for Stochastic L-systems. If you haven't already checked
		out the basics of L-Systems I encourage you to try some of the previous examples in this series.
		The provided settings are much the same as before, but now we have rule probabilities. This means
		that unlike before a rule might not be applied. For instance if a rule has a probability of 0.50,
		then it will occur half of the times it is encountered. With our basic example we can now generate
		unique variations simply by not having the replacements occur in a known pattern. Another side effect
		is that if we have multiple F rules such as F[0.5] -> A and F[0.5] -> B then if the first replacement
		doesn't occur the second one will be considered and in this case have a 50% chance of being used.
		Duplicate rules below each other in the list will essentially have a chance equal to all previous
		duplicate rules probabilities muliplied together.
		</p>
		<ul style="text-align: left">
			<li>F tells the program to draw forward Line Draw Length far</li>
			<li>+ and - rotate the direction the next line will be drawn by the angle</li>
			<li>[ tells the program to remember it's current location.</li>
			<li>] tells the program to return to the last saved location</li>
			<li>Rulebox 1 is the symbol that will be replaced</li>
			<li>Rulebox 2 is the probability of replacement</li>
			<li>Rulebox 3 is what will replace the first part of the rule</li>
			<li>Remove rule removes the most recently added rule</li>
			<li>Scaling is meant to help you make sure the drawing stays in the canvas</li>
			<li>Center will place the origin of the drawing in the center of the canvas</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Rules with a lot of symbols can get graphically dense quickly and cause browser lag.
		Be careful with how many times you hit generate, especially with the default example.
